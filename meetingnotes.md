Absolutely—here are all the *key flow-affecting details* and points you’ll want to capture if you’re building a flowchart (not the chart itself, just what would shape it):

---

### 1. **Trigger: Project Creation**

* **Trigger event:** CRM card in ODU is marked as "Closed Won"
* **Action:** Automatically pushes a new project into ClickUp with a template applied
* **Destination:** Goes to the "Unassigned" folder

---

### 2. **Assignment & Organization**

* **Monitor:** Corey monitors the unassigned folder and assigns a project manager (PM)

* **Upon assignment:**

  * Project moves into the corresponding *account folder* (if folder doesn’t exist, it’s created)
  * *Example logic:* New SitStill Kids Salon → assigned to Jorge → moves from Unassigned to SitStill
  * *Account folder handling:* If account folder doesn’t exist (e.g., “Papa John’s”), system should create it

* **Folder Structure Notes:**

  * For Crumbl: There is a main "Crumbl" folder, with projects under it (no subfolders for locations)
  * There’s a separate "Crumbl Refresh" for refresh programs; projects are placed based on their linked account
  * Project name = Opportunity name from CRM

---

### 3. **Template and Tasks**

* **Template application:** When a project is created, the template (with all default tasks and milestones) is automatically applied
* **Milestones:** E.g., Planning/Due Diligence, Permitting, Production, Install, etc.
* **Tasks:** Under each milestone are specific tasks
* **Dependencies:** Some tasks are dependent on others; not all tasks are dependent (many can be worked in parallel)

---

### 4. **Milestone/Status Transitions**

* **Initial status:** Project starts in Due Diligence/Planning
* **Status changes:**

  * When a task starts, project status (milestone) updates accordingly
  * *Example:* Starting “Request for Permit Application Submittal” moves project to “Permitting” milestone
  * *Task completion or start* can trigger the milestone change
* **Not every milestone requires sequential tasks:** Some tasks in the same milestone can run in parallel (dependencies exist only for some)

---

### 5. **Visibility & Views**

* **PM dashboards:**

  * PMs should see tasks relevant to them (filtered views to prevent overwhelm)
  * Full project plan should still be accessible if needed
* **Task visibility toggling:** Option for a “Task View” checkbox to toggle all tasks vs. current tasks only
* **Due date logic:** Filtered dashboard can show “what’s due this week” or similar criteria

---

### 6. **Scheduling Logic**

* **Backscheduling:**

  * You can enter a required install completion date
  * The system should *backschedule* all tasks and milestones based on durations/dependencies, so PMs know what’s due when
  * Example: Install Complete is always set as “estimated opening date minus 14 days”
  * If dates don’t fit, flags can highlight timeline problems (e.g., permits and production might need squeezing)
* **Dynamic scheduling:**

  * If tasks complete early/late, all subsequent dates should adjust dynamically (no static baseline)
  * Original planned dates aren’t preserved (dates shift as progress is made)

---

### 7. **Assignment of Tasks**

* **Default:** All tasks assigned to the PM by default
* **Exception:** PM (e.g., Corey) can reassign specific tasks to another (e.g., project coordinator) if needed, but not by default

---

### 8. **Data Structure & Reporting Needs**

* **Header/data needed for flow and reporting:**

  * PM name, account name, order dollars, etc. should be static fields visible at all times (not as tasks)
  * This header info should be always visible for reporting and reference (not embedded in tasks)
* **Dashboard/reporting:** Need visibility of project-level info at a glance (who, what account, dollars, etc.)

---

### 9. **Templates and Testing**

* **Templates:** Tasks and dependencies should be loaded as templates and tested to ensure proper flow and scheduling
* **Testing:** Need to run tests on these templates to make sure scheduling and dependencies function as expected

---

### 10. **Special/Edge Cases**

* **New account creation:** If a project is for a new client, system should create account folder automatically
* **Multiple assignments:** If PM is overloaded, tasks may be delegated, but project-level assignment doesn’t change
* **No “FYI” tasks:** Every task in ClickUp is PM’s responsibility unless reassigned

---

### 11. **System integration triggers**

* **ODU (CRM) → ClickUp:** Closed/Won triggers new project
* **ClickUp → PM assignment:** PM assigned triggers move to account folder, and application of template if not already applied

---

### 12. **General User Experience Requirements**

* Avoid overwhelming users: Use views/filters
* Make dependencies clear: So people know what unlocks when
* Make reporting easy: Show static project fields at all times

| Assignment          | PM assigned by Corey                        | Move to account folder (create if new) | Folder logic based on account       |
| Folder Structure    | —                                           | —                                      | Main folder, no subfolders for locs |
| Milestones/Statuses | Task started/completed                      | Project status changes                 | Follows dependencies                |

| Dependencies        | Set in template, some parallel, some serial | Can be edited/tested                   | Not every task is dependent         |
